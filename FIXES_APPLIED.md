# Fixes Applied - Tab Data Synchronization

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Manufacturer Details API Error** ✅
**Problem:** Tab 3 (Details) was showing error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pin')"

**Root Cause:** 
- `fetchManufacturerDetails` was expecting a `company` object
- Renderer was passing `{ pin: appState.companyData.pin }` instead of `{ company: appState.companyData }`

**Fix:** Updated `renderer.js` line 856-858 to pass the full company object

### 2. **Tab Not Showing Company Info** ✅
**Problem:** When switching to Tab 2 (Validate) or Tab 3 (Details), the company name and PIN were not displayed

**Root Cause:**
- The `switchTab` function only changed which tab was visible
- It didn't update the display fields with the current company data

**Fix:** Enhanced `switchTab` function to:
- Auto-populate validation tab with company name and PIN when switching to it
- Auto-display manufacturer details if already fetched when switching to details tab

### 3. **Manufacturer Details Simplified** ✅
**Problem:** Manufacturer details was trying to login with browser, requiring password and CAPTCHA

**Root Cause:**
- Function was unnecessarily complex
- The manufacturer API is public and doesn't require authentication

**Fix:** 
- Simplified `fetchManufacturerDetails` to call API directly
- No browser launch needed
- No password or CAPTCHA required
- Only needs PIN

## How It Works Now

### Workflow:

1. **Tab 1 (Setup):**
   - Enter PIN and Password
   - Click "Get Company Details" → Fetches from manufacturer API
   - Company data saved to `appState.companyData`
   - Click "Validate Credentials" → Verifies login (optional)

2. **Tab 2 (Validate):**
   - When you switch to this tab, company name and PIN are **automatically displayed**
   - Click "Run Password Validation" to validate credentials

3. **Tab 3 (Details):**
   - When you switch to this tab, company info is ready
   - Click "Fetch Manufacturer Details" → Fetches using PIN from Tab 1
   - No need to re-enter PIN or password

## Code Changes Made

### File: `renderer.js`

#### Change 1: Fixed manufacturer details call (line 856-858)
```javascript
// BEFORE
const result = await ipcRenderer.invoke('fetch-manufacturer-details', {
    pin: appState.companyData.pin
});

// AFTER
const result = await ipcRenderer.invoke('fetch-manufacturer-details', {
    company: appState.companyData
});
```

#### Change 2: Enhanced switchTab function (added lines 246-265)
```javascript
// Update displays when switching tabs
if (tabId === 'password-validation' && appState.companyData) {
    // Update validation tab with company info
    if (elements.validationCompanyName) {
        elements.validationCompanyName.textContent = appState.companyData.name || '-';
    }
    if (elements.validationPIN) {
        elements.validationPIN.textContent = appState.companyData.pin || '-';
    }
    if (appState.validationStatus) {
        updateValidationDisplay({ status: appState.validationStatus });
    }
}

if (tabId === 'manufacturer-details' && appState.companyData) {
    // Show company info on manufacturer details tab
    if (appState.manufacturerData) {
        displayManufacturerDetails(appState.manufacturerData);
    }
}
```

### File: `manufacturer-details.js`

#### Change 3: Simplified fetchManufacturerDetails (lines 40-116)
```javascript
async function fetchManufacturerDetails(company, progressCallback) {
    // Now directly calls API without browser/login
    const pin = company.pin || company;
    
    const formData = new URLSearchParams();
    formData.append('manPin', pin);

    const response = await fetch(MANUFACTURER_API_URL, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { /* simple headers */ },
        body: formData.toString(),
    });
    
    // Process and return data
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start fresh:** Close and restart the app
2. **Tab 1:** Enter PIN and password, click "Get Company Details"
3. **Tab 2:** Switch to Validate tab → Company name and PIN should appear automatically
4. **Tab 3:** Switch to Details tab → Click "Fetch Manufacturer Details" (should work without error)

---

## Expected Behavior Now

✅ Tab 1 fetches company details (no login required)  
✅ Tab 2 automatically shows company name and PIN from Tab 1  
✅ Tab 3 can fetch manufacturer details using data from Tab 1  
✅ No "undefined reading 'pin'" errors  
✅ All tabs synchronized with company data
